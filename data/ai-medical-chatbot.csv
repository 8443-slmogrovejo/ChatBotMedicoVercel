Q. What should I do to reduce my weight gained due to genetic hypothyroidism?,"Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old female who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (genetic) when I was 12. Over the past five years, I have become around 50 pounds overweight and all of my attempts to lose have seemed to fail so I have given up, but my weight has stayed the same. There is so much information put there about losing weight with hypothyroidism but it all seems to conflict. I am so unsure as to what type of exercise and diet I should follow as a result but I still would like to lose weight, but most importantly have my body feel better. What can I do? I am currently on Levothyroxine, Buspar, and Benedryl.","Hi. You have really done well with the hypothyroidism problem. Your levels are normal with less medications which are very good. As it is genetically induced, it is very difficult to lose weight. My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life. Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward. Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour. If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking. Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking. Avoid partying and binge eating. Follow the food timings properly. Have small frequent meals. In between snacks should be strictly fruits or any kind of low-calorie foods. Have unsalted nuts around five daily. It can give a glow to your dry skin. Everyday water intake should be around 1.5-2 liters. You can use flax seeds. Powder it and mix it in your food. It is a fiber which will give you fullness. Use turmeric, fenugreek seeds, or powder every day. It is a good antioxidant and fenugreek helps in reducing cholesterol levels. Include low-fat milk, curd every day. Egg white, lean chicken, or fish can be taken daily in moderation (anyone). Organ meats need to be avoided. Is your menstrual cycle normal? Please get back if you have any other complaints. Follow up after 15 days."
"Q. I have started to get lots of acne on my face, particularly on my forehead. Please help me.","Hi doctor! I used to have clear skin but since I moved to a new place, I started to have lots of acne on my face particularly on my forehead. I thought it would disappear once I went back home, but it only got worse. I did some research and assumed that it was caused by drinking too much cow's milk, but it has been since since I stopped and they would still not go away. I also noticed that I get deep acne whenever I'm nearing my period, along with the usual small red bumps. I bought an acne soap and have been using it for a month now but I'm not sure if it works. I hope you can help me because it has been affecting my mental state lately :((((",Hi there Acne has multifactorial etiology. Only acne soap does not improve if ypu have grade 2 or more grade acne. You need to have oral and topical medications. This before writing medicines i need to confirm your grade of acne. For mild grade topical clindamycin or retenoic acud derivative would suffice whereas for higher grade acne you need oral medicines aluke doxycycline azithromycin or isotretinoin.

Q. Why do I have uncomfortable feeling between the middle of my spine and left shoulder blade?,"Hello doctor,I am having an uncomfortable feeling in between the middle of my spine and left shoulder blade. It seems to get stiff, and my bones pop a lot around there, and it is very uncomfortable to sit in specific ways feels like my bones shift, well the other night it seemed as if my shoulder would pop out of place causing more stiffness after a while of dealing with it. I ended up feeling a popping sensation, where the stiffness was an instant relief. It was so shocking it put my anxiety through the roof. I thought I was going to die because my whole body was shaking and tingling. What am I dealing with? Right now I have no pain or tender near that area still relief but curious on what happened and why I got this shock and that popping feeling so loud it scared me half to death.","Hello. The popping and discomfort what you felt is either because of improper scapulothoracic mobility or may be due to facet joint irritation in the neck with intervertebral hypermobility. Which could have caused due to stiffness in the chest muscles, shoulder stiffness, etc.  I would recommend you to do a lot of icing in the chest and back muscles. Maintain your neck and upper back posture by doing some back retraction work. Gently stretch your neck and chest. Gently massage your chest and shoulders to relieve tension in the muscles. I hope this is helpful for now. Kindly revert in case you need any help in this regard."
Q. My symptoms after intercourse threatns me even after having negative HIV result. Kindly help.,"Hello doctor,Before two years had sex with a call girl in a dark location for about 10 to15 min. I did not eject, and I am sure that she did not eject as well (not 100 % sure). Do not know if the condom broke (as it was dark) but had some liquid on my penis (maybe fluid in condom, not sure) After few days from then I had cold followed by itchy skin. I took medicine from the doctor and got it resolved.After a few weeks from then, I had fever 100 F, mild night sweats, mild sore throat, slight weight loss (around four to five kg). Also I feel tired most of times. After 50 days, I got an HIV blood test, which came out negative. Do not know the name of the test, they took blood from my fingertip, tested it using some chemical for 40 minutes, and gave a report. Doctor suggested me get the same test after three months. Now I took medicines for flu symptoms which are giving me relief. But, very worried about the situation. Will medicine I used for cold and itchy skin have impact on HIV. Was the test enough for diagnosis as I do not know the name like fourth-generation etc. Also I washed my penis after 20 minutes with water thoroughly. Please help.","Hello. The HIV test uses a finger prick blood sample, with results given within 20 minutes, and is 99 % accurate at detecting any HIV exposure that may have occurred more than 12 weeks ago. However, it can potentially pick up HIV infection from as little as four weeks ago. There is nothing to worry nothing will happen, and please repeat your test after 12 weeks. If you want accurate results to get, it has done RNA PCR which will give actual results within 10days. Antigen detection like P24 gives best results with in two to four weeks. Probably your suffering from a simple viral upper respiratory infection. After 12 weeks, please consult your doctor he will examine and treat you accordingly."
Q. I had a surgery which ended up with some failures. What can I do to fix it?,"Hello doctor,I had an emergency surgery six months ago punched through a window right arm cut both arteries cut radial nerve with ulnar damage and cut bicep tendon nerves back now almost full thumbs up the only issue is bicep. My question is there something I can do to fix it like lengthening surgery, or am I stuck? I am a boxer supposed to go Olympics this year. My surgeon focused on the nerve and did not care help. PS pronator is still little and has not fully recovered.","Hello. If you are saying it is already six months since the surgery and if you are doing regular physiotherapy, still has not gained much of the actions, then it is not worth waiting anymore. There are many muscle transfer surgeries which can give you the desired movements and help you in day today activities. But you have to remember that post such operations you will require time to train the brain and get the full use of such movements. That will take time. Do not want to demotivate you, but tremendous training and hard work might be required to reach the pre trauma stage of your boxing."
Q. Kindly explain about Beta Strep.,"Hello doctor, My culture from my gynecologist came back, showing that I have a yeast infection as well as Beta Strep. I was hoping for more information on Beta Strep. I have never heard of it, and there is a lot of information when I searched that is making me confused a little. I am not experiencing any symptoms, either. I feel perfectly fine.","Hello. There are lots of bacteria and other organisms that colonize healthy skin. Yeast a fungus also is a commensal in our body. Just the presence of these organisms is of no significance. The colony count is needed, which is high, will need a course of antibiotics, which can be decided by culture and sensitivity. But after a surgery like what you had, or any significant stress or use of lots of antibiotics (as would have happened after surgery) or use of steroids or diabetes, all infections show an altered balance between good and bad bacteria. You do not need any treatment for this. Just wait for your body to develop those good bacteria, and gradually, all tests will come negative. If you have any symptoms, treat as per need. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics use. They will further delay the recovery. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."
Q. Kindly suggest a homeopathic medicine to stop hairfall and promote hair growth.,"Hello doctor,I am 24 years old, and for the past nine years, I am facing hair fall problem nowadays my 60 % of hair is falling on my top and front of my head. I checked my thyroid and hemoglobin many times, but their reports are good. I use many home remedies and hair oils, but when I stop using it again, it starts falling. The allopathic doctor says use Minoxidil 5 %, Finasteride, and hair serum. But Finasteride has many side effects. Can you please tell me is any medicine available in homeopathy which stops hair fall and promotes hair growth if yes can you please tell me the name.","Hello. I checked the attached photo (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and read your description. It seems you have been suffering from hair loss problem for a longtime. Do you eat healthy food like vegetables and fruits every day? Sometimes lack of nutrition is also the reason for hair loss. Do you know if your father also differed from hair loss issue at this young age? Did you suffer from severe health issues or chronic illnesses? If you do not think above mentioned is the cause for your hair fall, then the only reason I can think is that you have been going through severe stress which has taken a toll on your health. Homeopathy would be a good option in this case as it will cure our problem from the root cause, and there will be no side effects. So to prescribe you a correct homeopathic remedy I need to understand your mental, emotional, and physical state. He ce I need detail case history which can be done either through face to face consultation or online consultation. I would advise you to visit a good homeopath for consultation. For the time being, you can apply arnica hair oil twice a week on your hair. Just mix one spoon of Arnica oil with five spoons of coconut oil and apply all over your scalp. You can gently massage your ear with this mixture. Try this for 15 days and then let me know how you feel. I hope you start feeling better. Let me know if you have any questions."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Q. Can a painless tooth be extracted since it has a hole in it?,"Hello doctor,Can I pull out hard teeth out no pain because I got a hole in my teeth? Whenever I use to eat something, it got stuck in it and caused severe pain. Kindly give me some advice about pulling it out without any pain.","Hello. I had gone through your question, and I can understand your concern. If the pain occurs only when you eat food and it gets stuck into it, it is reversible pulpitis. For that, you do not need to get it extracted. You need to get it filled, and it will cost you less than that of pulling (extraction). Second, you will save your tooth too. My suggestion is to get dental filling done as soon as possible. If you want to get it removed, you need to visit a doctor (dentist), and there will be no pain because during extraction local anesthesia is given."

Kindly send clear photos of the same to make a conclusive diagnosis. Meanwhile, you can start using the following medicines. 1. Tab Fluconazole 400 mg start and repeat once after a week. 2. 2 % Ketoconazole lotion apply for 5-7 mins and wash off once a day."
Q. I get fever during rainy and winter season. Why?,"Hello doctor, During rainy and winter season get frequent fevers. Most of the times I get it diagnosed, and every time doctors tell it is only viral fever. Fevers generally come twice a month. I take Paracetamol and Cefixime usually (on the advice of doctors). Generally, the illnesses go in 10 days. This has been happening from the last three years. Can you suggest any cure for it? I am a small time businessman, and this is affecting my financials. Regarding my medical history, I am a premature baby of seven months. As told by my mom and relatives, I remained alive on medicines with great difficulty. And also from childhood, I used to get skin diseases frequently, and for that, I think I was regularly administered antibiotics.","Hello. I need to know a few things, 1. Do you feel feverish, or does the thermometer record a temperature? 2. What other symptoms do you get? Runny or blocked nose, sore throat, throat pain with swallowing, headaches, body pains, etc. 3. Does anyone else around you (family members, co-workers, etc.) develop similar symptoms before or after you do? 4. Do you get any tests done like blood tests or X-rays during those episodes? From your description, it appears that you are getting frequent viral upper respiratory tract infections. These are acquired from other patients through the air (coughing, sneezing, etc.). They are usually short-lived and last no more than five to seven days. Since more than 300 different viruses can cause similar symptoms, you can get infected multiple times each time with a different virus. The same virus cannot affect you again. Unfortunately, antibiotics do not work against viruses. They are meant for bacterial infections only. However, doctors continue to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily, and this has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance.  Other than symptomatic treatment, no medicine can cure or prevent these infections. They are self-limited, and you will get better even if you do not take any medication. The older you get, the less frequently you will get these infections as your body will be building up defenses with every disease. No household tips or vitamin supplements have been proven to work. Premature birth can lead to increased frequency of infections, but unless the infections are bacterial, not much can be done about them. Please get back to me with answers to the above questions and also attach any test reports you may have."
Q. Why does one develop swelling after snake bite?,"Hi doctor, I am a 40 year old female. I got cottonmouth bite on the back of the left and right ankle. Three people saw and confirmed that as cottonmouth. I do not believe much venom was released. It happened under shallow water. I got immediate pain as if repeatedly the ankle and feet got hit with a bat and a burning swelling began quickly. I went to the ER. They monitored my blood for two hours and decided no antivenom. I was not given either a tetanus shot or any antibiotics. From the laboratory work, they said everything looks good, but I could not stand or walk. They sent me home with Ultram and Ibuprofen 800 mg. After two days, the swelling slightly increased instead of going down. My fiance took me to different hospitals. The swelling and the fang marks were evident. Again, the laboratory work came back as normal. I was still in pain and swollen ankles. They gave steroid IM injection and Prednisone pack and suggested antihistamine. It has been six days. Still, I cannot stand, walk or care for myself in any way. The swelling has not got down. I have kept it elevated and put some cool fabric packs on swollen areas. It seems to help with burning sensation. I have been drinking Echinacea tea, water and taking all medicines prescribed such as Ultram, Benadryl, Prednisone and Ibuprofen 800 mg. Back of my legs up to the thigh is swollen, entire legs hurt and tender to even minimal touch. Bruising has darkened and the swelling has not gone down. There are no red lines and no skin rotting. What shall I do now? I want the swelling to get relieved. I am scared. How to reduce the swelling? Please tell me what I need to do just to be able to stand briefly.

The most common cause of proptosis is thyroid abnormality (hyperthyroidism) and called thyroid eye disease (TED). In this condition, eye muscle gets enlarged due to GAG (glycosaminoglycans) material deposition. This condition usually resolves after active and quiet phase that takes up to five to seven years. During this time the actual cause is treated (hyperthyroidism) and for proptosis steroids may be given (that you have already taken). Enlarged muscles can compress the optic nerve and can cause permanent vision loss. So you need to consult an endocrinologist for the treatment of thyroid abnormality. Quit smoking (if you are a smoker) and keep follow your eye doctor to avoid complication that can cause permanent vision loss. You are welcome for any queries."

Is it tumors or parasites or a neurological problem?","Hello. Cold and sweaty hands and feet can happen in heart failure, anxiety, hyperthyroidism and shock. Numb feet, which are painful while walking can be due to neuropathy, nerve root compression at lumbosacral spine, or arterial occlusion in legs. The half closed eyelids can be ptosis, or something else. I suggest you get the following tests done: Since when you are having these problems?

Q. Suffering from subclinical hyperthyroidism with anxiety and palpitations.,"Dear Doctor, I am trying to figure out what is wrong with my 15 year old daughter. Her symptoms have developed most significantly over the past few months, and include depression, weakness, constant light-headedness, shortness of breath (even when sitting still), difficulty taking a deep breath (causes pain), episodes where breathing becomes especially difficult, a complete lack of energy, continual exhaustion, continual muscle soreness (especially in the calves), cold hands and feet (to the point of turning blue), intolerance to cold and heat especially, episodes of a racing heartbeat, and episodes of anxiety and disorientation. At first our focus was on her was depression but now our focus is shifting toward her problems with physical activity and breathing, especially as she has now come to the point where she can no longer participate in any sports. We have seen a psychiatrist for her depression who discovered the MTHFR Mutation, which has since been addressed with a megadose of methyl folate. After three weeks on the medication there has been no improvement. Her paediatrician tested her for asthma and the results were negative. We have put her on various vitamin B supplements and have made sure she is getting proper nutrition and rest. Again, nothing has helped. Other labwork, as well as some of her symptoms, has made us consider her thyroid. The thyroid results are as follows:  TSH: 0.059 ulU/ml. AntioTPO-Ab: 84.9 IU/mL. Anti-Thyroglobulin: 134 IU/mL. Total T3: 130 ng/dL. T4: 10.5 ug/dL. Other labs that were out of the normal range are as follows:  - Ferritin: 31 ng/mL (her other iron results were normal). - Differential (Audo Diff) Neutrophils: 66%. In spite of a low TSH we have been told that as long as the T4 level is within normal range there is no need for attention with the thyroid. Yet, I canno help but keep coming back to the thyroid and wonder if this is not where we should focus our efforts. Any thoughts please?","Hi, It is really sad to know about your daughter. 1. As a matter of fact your daughter seems to have acute thyroiditis. Though the thyroid profile has not shown full blown thyrotoxic state, she has subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH being suppressed. Since how long has she been like this? Thyroiditis might take 8-12 weeks to settle. How old are the reports? Thyroiditis might leave the patient hypothyroid. 2. Secondly she is 15, puberty is another phase of major hormonal and emotional change over. How are her periods? Has she put on weight? or lost some? You have supplemented with multivitamins, please see if B12 upto 1500 mcg is being given and Vitamin D 1000 IU daily or 60,000 IU once a week is going. Also supplement her with calcium and magnesium and check these levels as well. Treat her with Propranolol 10mg twice a day to beat the anxiety and palpitations.

Q. Is PAP test valid for screening prostatitis symptoms?,"Hi doctor, I asked my doctor to do PSA test. The PSA came back normal at 1.0 ng/mL. However, he also did prostatic acid phosphatase test which was high at 4.5 ng/mL. My question is whether prostatic acid phosphatase test is valid for screening or not? Should I need to do these tests again? I had prostatitis symptoms in the past. Now, it seems to be fine.","Hi. I have gone through your query. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) has been replaced by PSA (prostate-specific antigen test). It is better in the detection of prostate cancer compared to PAP. The elevation of PAP levels alone is not a cause for concern. I hope your treating doctor has done a rectal exam to find out any prostate nodules. If it is normal, then it is not necessary to repeat the tests. Hope this helps you. Feel free to revert back with any questions. For more information consult an urologist online -->"
Q. Why is my free PSA abnormal?,"Hello doctor, 50 years old, 5.8 inches, 260 lbs. On blood pressure pills. My doctor is out of town for a few weeks. I reviewed PSA test results and apparently I have one abnormal reading out of three. PSA total 0.5, PSA free 0.1, PSA % free 20. The PSA % free 20 is in red indicating abnormal. What does this mean? What causes it to be abnormal?","Hi. Free PSA should be more than 15 % to rule out prostate cancer. Free PSA is an additional tool used when PSA is above 2.5 and we want to check whether high PSA is due to benign prostate growth or due to prostate cancer. Some laboratories use 25 % cutoff, but most have 15 % cutoff value. Since your total PSA is quite low and free PSA is above 15 %, you should not worry. If in doubt, repeat after a few months."
Q. I have frequent urination and minimal calcification. Does it mean prostate cancer?,"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. I am worried about my prostate as my grandfather had prostate cancer and my father had an enlargement but was already cured. I had an ultrasound last year due to frequent urinating and result showed minimal calcification a year back. The Radiologist told me that the calcification has nothing to worry as it was not that serious and my doctor (internal medicine) also did not care about it. But I am still worried as what I have read is that even at a young age you can have prostate cancer. Though I am still experiencing frequent urination (I am now drinking a lot of water 2 to 3 liters a day) now, my creatinine is in normal level and KUB is all normal.","Hi. I have gone through your query. It is extremely unlikely for you to develop prostate cancer at your age. Even in families with hereditary prostate cancer, the usual age people develop cancer is above 40 years of age at the lowest, though it is usually between 50 to 60 years. That said, in your case, it is too early to jump to conclusions of having prostate cancer in your family. The most likely explanation for your symptoms could be a mild urinary tract infection or even your increased fluid intake. Prostatic calcification is commonly seen and does not imply anything significant to worry now. If you are concerned, you can do a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test and a prostate exam at 40 years. If normal, then you can repeat it after three years interval. For more information consult an urologist online -->"
Q. Please enlighten me on non-invasive procedures to detect prostate cancer.,"Hello doctor, I am a 79 year old male. Excellent health, take no medications with the exception of an occasional Viagra. In a recent DRE, my urologist discovered two small nodules on my prostate. A PSA at the time was 6.3. Over the years, I have ranged in 2's and 3's. He suggested a biopsy of the prostate. I have read many negative things about this process. I have also read about nonevasive procedures to detect for cancer.","Hi. I have gone through your query. I concur with your urologist in the need for a biopsy. Any PSA (prostate-specific antigen) more than 4 or abnormal findings on DRE (digital rectal examination) needs evaluation to rule out prostate cancer. None of the non-invasive techniques are sufficiently accurate as a biopsy at present. The closest is an MRI which, if positive, needs to be confirmed by a biopsy, and if negative does not exactly rule out a malignancy, you will need a biopsy nevertheless. Many blood tests are available but those are only if the DRE is normal and will not be applicable in your situation. Hope this was helpful, feel free to revert back with any other questions.

Q. When should I stop Clexane and Ecosprin should before delivery?,"Hello doctor, Presently I am on my 34 th weeks of pregnancy. LMP was before eight months. I had an IUD of more than 37 weeks before two years. Present medications are Clexane 20, and Ecosprin 75 daily. As per my doctor's planning, I should go for C-section between 36 to 37 weeks. Now when I should stop my Claxene and Ecospirin? This medication is given by my gynecologist after analyzing my boh panel report which states lupus anticoagulant by DRVTT is 45.50. No lupus-like anticoagulant present, APTT is 31.30 and PTT-LA is 98.80. Kindly advice.","Hello.  I feel that it would be the best if you do not stop these medicines without the advice of your doctor who recommended these and made a plan for your pregnancy because self-treatment strategy will lead to no benefits. And both of these drugs are safe to use, so you do not have to worry. Furthermore, for your knowledge, aspirin is usually stopped at 35 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, and Clexane (Enoxaparin sodium) is being continued until delivery, and even after that. So I would again say that please take advice from your particular doctor before stopping any of these medications as your pregnancy is very precious. I hope it has helped you.

Q. Are my symptoms due to HIV infection? I had a high-risk exposure 15 months ago.,"Hi doctor, After 15 months of unprotected sex, I went for HIV test called Comb AIDS test but, the result came back negative for both HIV-1 and 2. Again after three months, I redid the test, but even this time, the result was negative. I was not satisfied, so I went for ELISA test, and again the results came back negative. I consulted two general physicians, who told me that I do not have HIV. But, I am still worried because of the symptoms that I have. I am a male, who weighs 62 kg, and I am 6 feet tall. The symptoms i'm having are:  severe weakness, ulcers in mouth and tongue, fatigue, pain in legs while sleeping, itching in the private part, occasional sore throat, occasional itching and pain in ears, and black spots on my back.  I remember having loose motions after a week of unprotected sex. At that time, the doctor told me that I have food poisoning, and I was alright after taking medicines. Are these HIV tests done by me reliable? Was the loose motion caused due to HIV? Is it possible that my immune system was so weak to detect antibodies during my HIV test? Should I go for another test such as PCR RNA test? Please help me, I am worried. Your kind response will be appreciated. Thank you.","Hi. The test kits used to diagnose HIV are highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. The majority of the people who are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) develop antibodies by three months, and even in the rare instances of late seroconversions, they develop HIV antibodies by six months. You can rely on your HIV screening test results. If there had been no other exposure other than that, you do not require any further test. The symptoms which you mentioned could be due to various reasons and cannot be attributed to HIV. In fact, there are no specific symptoms or signs which can lead to the diagnosis of HIV. As per the above information, you are HIV negative. Just relax. Hope your query is answered, but if you have any other query, please do not hesitate to ask or call anytime. Best wishes.

Most of the persons who are over-possessive of their partner show certain kinds of behavior that is uncommon in the general population. They feel less secure and this sense of insecurity is the driving force for the over-possessive nature. Someone who is insecure may doubt their partner's dedication and may, therefore, try to control them. In short, they feel vulnerable and will do anything to make sure they are not hurt. The sense of insecurity can stem from a number of situations including parents leaving a child, a past romantic partner who was unfaithful and many more.

"Q. As I am having a history of miscarriages, will taking hCG injections help me to continue pregnancy?","Hello doctor, My lmp was on five months ago. I was spotting for three days during my lmp and got a positive strip test after seven days. My beta hCG level on the day of a positive result was 126, and after two days, it was 125. I am being told that I will get periods in two weeks but told to continue folic acid and multivitamin and come for ultrasound in three weeks if no periods come. I have a history of miscarriages, and I am 35 years old. Can hCG injections help me or should I consult another doctor? Have I miscarried or there are still chances?","Hello. Unfortunately what your doctor has said is right. Spotting in early pregnancy is normal. But a fall or no rise beta HCG is a poor sign. Beta hCG is a hormone produced from fetal tissue. At a level of 25 mIU/mL urine test is positive it doubles in 48 hours. So if the result of 7th is 125, then on 9th it should have been around 250 or more. Only healthy fetal tissue can produce an adequate amount of this hormone, so indirectly we get to know the health of the embryo even without seeing it. So it just means the fetal tissue is not growing. There can be lab errors, so to be on a safer side doctor has asked you to come for scan, to confirm.  If you are worried about the repeated miscarriages, have yourself and your partner checked for any problem. Causes like blood sugar levels, thyroid hormone problems, or prolactin hormone abnormalities, any structural problems in the uterus or any problem in semen. Do not lose hope, if you are getting pregnant without much help, no matter what the outcome is, then you will surely have babies. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."

Q. What causes warmness in the left side of chest?,"Hello doctor, I am 23 years old. I am obese and have a family history of cardiac arrest. My father got cardiac arrest at the age of 53. I have consulted the local cardiologist and gone through ECG, echo, TMT, lipid, hs-CRP and other blood tests. All the tests were normal except heart rate, which was 110 and also high BP. I am taking Rosufit 10, Nebistar 5 and Cilaheart 10. Currently, I am feeling warm in the left side of my chest for a short span of time. Sometimes, I have slight pain in my left hand and feels like a pinch type of pain in the center of the chest when I inhale and exhale. Is it normal?","Hello. This kind of chest pain occurs during stress and anxiety only. We label them nonspecific cardiac chest pain. But, we should always keep in consideration cardiac chest pain and acid reflux. It is important to differentiate between the all. However, the cardiac chest pain is severe and crushing in nature. It increases on activity like walking and exercising. It also gets radiated to left arm. Since your ECG and other cardiac workup are normal, the pain is not due to cardiac issues. For acid reflux, I would advise you to take a combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone once a day. Your increase in heart rate might be possibly because of anxiety only. For anxiety, try to do meditation and if no relief, you would be treated with anti-anxiety drugs like Etizolam. For further clarifications consult a cardiologist online -->"

But, I could not control myself. I saw my mother naked sometimes and this fed my lust towards her even more. I am getting dirty thoughts about her when I think about having love with her. I also watch porn especially incest. I want to express my love to her sexually. Please provide some way to overcome this. I am not under any medication. I am just trying to control myself mentally.","Hello. I can understand your problem. Sexual feelings in an adult towards a female are considered as normal and acceptable. But, such feelings towards any female with blood relationship are not acceptable in any society and this result in significant blow to reputation and respect. The feelings you have described towards your own mother are wrong and should be controlled. In future this might result in relationship problem in your case especially towards your wife. This might result in difficulty in maintaining relationship with any other female. To overcome the problem you have to work hard. One thing is that stop watching porn completely. If that is not possible at this moment then watch videos only and avoid going to forums or reading stories of incest online. Such things increase the perversions. Avoid watching any material that relates to incest. I am not saying that you should stop masturbating but stop thinking about incest. You are having guilty after incest ideas, so most likely these are intrusive ideas and should be treated also. If possible visit a psychiatrist for help. Medicines like Paroxetine or Fluoxetine can help to control your intrusive ideas and you will feel better. These are safe medicines. Spend your time in outdoor activities. Gym and sports will help to vent out your energy and you will feel better. Avoid spending more time on computer and if your work permits then stop using computer or internet for some days. This will help you to overcome the addiction. Psychological conflicts. For further information consult a psychiatrist online.--->"
Q. Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?,"Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Q. My gums behind the last tooth is swollen and painful. Is it due to food impaction?,"Hello doctor, I am an 18 year old, who dislikes visiting the dentist. Therefore, you can imagine my hygiene is very good. I had a brief period of gingivitis as a result of using braces for three years. Having removed my braces over a year ago, and lucky for me, I do not have wisdom teeth, the end of my dental pain seemed over. However, about five days ago all of a sudden, I woke up and the very back of my mouth around the last left molar is swollen. It is sore and irritable. I kept brushing and using salt water. There is no bleeding or pus, but it started to feel more irritable and tender as if it was an infection. It has not gotten worse in swelling or pain, but it has not gotten better either. My mother predicts a piece of food of some sort got wedged in the gum line, near my tongue. We have tried using Orajel to numb it enough so I could use floss or a toothpick to work around the gum, but it still is very painful to touch and it is very hard to reach that area. Sadly for me, I am starting my Invisalign treatment and I am going to get the impressions tomorrow. And I also have an appointment for a regular cleaning. I am petrified. Do you think a piece of food is the problem? Is there something I can do to remove the food before my appointment tomorrow? What will the dentist do tomorrow when I ask him to address the situation? What are the chances this is a bigger infection and is not food related, what will the dentist do then? Will I have to have surgery or procedure done or antibiotics will help?",Hi. Regards.

Q. Is talking to myself in front of the mirror a symptom of schizophrenia?,"Hi doctor, I am a 24 year old female. I am a healthy and happy person. I eat well and exercise well. I have a lot of friends, cool hobbies, etc. But, I have a weird habit. Whenever I am alone I talk to myself standing in front of the mirror. I imagine a lot. I think so many things like I am in an interview and I try to venture out the best answers and framing smart answers. When I am practicing on my guitar, I imagine lots of people are watching me and appreciating me for playing so well. I imagine futuristic conversations with people where I ask a question and answer them. When I am alone, I keep imagining some stuff. Also, I pick up some topic and start talking to myself in front of the mirror. I personally feel this habit has improved my communication skills, confidence and vocabulary. I am not shy and I do not have stage fear. When I meet my friends or when I am giving presentations at college, I am the one who used to stay very confident. However, some days back, when I was talking to myself in front of the mirror, my mom questioned me. Until now I did not pay much attention to what I was doing. But, ever since my mom saw me doing that I have become conscious. I have stopped talking to myself for two to three days. But, I do not feel like I have been missing out on anything. I am still friendly and confident. But, I am just wondering if I have crossed the line of sanity. I searched about this on the internet and came across something called as schizophrenia. Is this disorder setting with my habit? Do I have schizophrenia or any other disorder? To be honest, after reading about this schizophrenia I am very scared. It sounds like a very serious disorder to me. Please help.","Hi. I read your query with keen interest and understand your concerns. From the available description, I do not think you have crossed the limit of sanity or you developed schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is altogether very different disorder where people have abnormal perceptions such as hearing voices when no one is present and seeing objects when nothing is there. I do not see any of them with you. In my view, you need to put your worries at rest and do what your mind and heart considers right. It may be abnormal for your mother, but there is no pathology with this. If you feel more assistance is required or my answer to your query is far from setting down the worries, then it is better to see a psychiatrist in person.

Q. Why do I have a wet feeling inside the anus?,"Hello doctor, I have a wet feeling inside the anus for the past one year. I did a colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, and the doctor said that everything is fine. They said probably the wet feeling is due to sweat.

Q. Is it likely for HIV symptoms to show up after 5 to 6 weeks of possible exposure?,"Hello doctor, I am a 31 year old male, and my query is regarding possible HIV exposure. Four months back, I had a sexual encounter with two female partners. I had insertive vaginal sex and received oral sex. Intercourse had lasted for about five minutes twice with each partner. Condoms were used throughout and were changed for every partner. I do not recall any of the condoms breaking or slipping off completely. About a week or so after the encounter, I experienced some health-related concerns, one after another.I got an eye stye, inside of the eyelid, which was little painful and irritating. It went away in a week. I got a boil, nearly an inch in diameter, in the lower abdomen, which subsided in a week. I also got a white area behind the wisdom tooth. This area was painful during the initial 3 to 4 days, then the pain subsided, and the white area started growing bigger. OPG and clinical examination suggested impacted wisdom tooth and trauma caused by friction of upper and lower wisdom teeth. So, I got both the wisdom teeth extracted. Now, it is normal.I also had a skin tag in the underarm area, which turned painful, hard, and dark purplish. One or two light reddish spots in the adjoining area. They resolved in 7 to 8 days. I have high blood pressure and triglycerides. My triglycerides were 292, which dropped to 195 after 10 days without medication. I got a severe headache one night, which went away next morning. I feel light-headed while walking, staring at the computer, etc., but not when lying down for 5 to 6 days. This happened concurrently with the diagnosis of high triglycerides and BP. I also have diarrhea type condition, that is, I have bowel movements thrice a day, which lasted for 9 to 10 days. My gastroenterologist remarked ‘no abnormalities detected.’ I took antibiotics and other medicines for the dental problem few days before this.I do not have a fever or any unusual skin rash. I do not have unusual body ache or weight loss or loss of appetite. I also do not have any apparent swollen glands. My creatinine and TSH test reports are normal. My LDL is normal, and HDL is little lower than normal. Assuming either of my partners was HIV positive, what is the chance of me contracting his? Does any of the above health concerns related to HIV? Does HIV symptoms, if any, appear together or can appear one after another? What is the most likely period after exposure when symptoms appear, if at all? In other words, is it likely for HIV symptoms to show after 5 to 6 weeks? I realize HIV infection can be confirmed only by a test. However, I sincerely request a prompt and clear response to the above queries, which will help me cut down the fear. Thank you.","Hi.

Q. My period has been late by 13 days. What could be the reason?,"Hello doctor, I am a 24 year old female. My period has been late by 13 days. I am sexually active. I took a home pregnancy test but that was negative. My period has been fairly regular in the past with them happening 4 days prior or after my date. I have taken emergency morning after pill in the past (thrice in the last 4 months). What could be the reason? Is there a possibility that I could still be pregnant after a negative test, though I have not had any other symptoms of pregnancy nor am I having any sought of discomfort?","Hello. The striking point in your history is that you have taken morning after pill thrice in the last 4 months. It has to be understood that the most common side effect of an emergency contraceptive pill is delaying the next 2-3 menstrual cycles.  As your pregnancy test is negative even after 13 days post period, it clearly indicates that you are not pregnant . Hence, the delay in periods is likely to be due to ipill side effect. Or another possible reason for the delay could be stress induced hormonal imbalance during this menstrual cycle. Stress including emotional, psychological, physical or social disturbances, all have a bearing on the reproductive hormones and can easily delay your menses, once pregnancy is ruled out.  It is suggested that you can wait for another week to allow your menses to resume naturally , if not then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterone pills to resume your menses.  As pregnancy test is negative, you can rest assured and wait for another week safely. For further queries, consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"

Q. Can I get pregnant with fingering after he touched his penis?,"Hi doctor, I had oral sex, and my partner ejaculated his sperms inside my mouth, and I sipped the sperm that came out. After that he touched his penis, then he grabbed my pants near my vagina twice. After that, he used the same fingers inside my vagina. It was my first time with the oral sex and fingering. I do not know that there were sperms in his hand. We did not have sex. But, can I get pregnant in this situation? I missed my periods this month. What is the cause?","Hi. In your case, there is a chance that semen might have entered into the vagina. As you have not done any sexual intercourse, there is less chance of getting pregnant. You have to rule out pregnancy by urine hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test. You can do this test at home. If pregnancy is not present, then thyroid problem and diabetes should be ruled out. Excess stress, obesity, prolonged fasting can also lead to a delayed period. You can consult a gynecologist for examination if needed. For more information consult a family physician online -->"
Q. What is the treatment for inguinal lymphadenopathy?,"Hi doctor, I am a 55 year old male. I am suffering from inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2 years ago I have this on right side and now on left side. There is a square shallow knot present on the right side now. I have stiffness and rigidity especially in the left arm and occasional limited movements. Also I have discomfort in my legs and inguinal region. On ultrasound it was observed lipomatosis of inguinal lymphs. I have painful point in inguinal region, only if I press. I have noticeable weakness, but no weight loss. Occasionally I feel very low energy and could not maintain erection. I feel numbness in the shoulder or finger when wake from sleep. I have low sedimentation rate. There is no abnormal blood and urine finding. I had blood test and it is negative for all infectious diseases such as Lyme, cat scratch, AIDS, etc. Please help with some suggestion. Thank you.","Hi. I assure you not to worry as all things may get settled with proper care and follow-up. 1. Inguinal lymph nodes usually get prominent due to some infection (that you say have been ruled out) or some primary pathology of the nodes themselves.  2. The knots you are talking about also warrants to rule out if that is a vein pathology or lymph nodes can be benign or cancerous changes. Biopsy of the nodes is mandatory especially when there we see changes on ultrasound.  3. Weakness can be due to hemoglobin or red blood cell deficiency. Other causes of weakness may be hypothyroidism or fluid and electrolyte imbalances.  4. Your low sedimentation rate may be due to red blood cell, white blood cell changes and protein abnormality. Sickle cell disease also may cause it. But clinical correlation is the key and for that your physician needs to go for physical examination and if suspicion arises, he may refer you to hematologist.  5. Pain in the lymphatic region can be due to lymph nodes being pressed on or it is possibly from lipomatous changes.  6. I also prefer you to get a detailed heart evaluation from cardiologist as weakness, shoulder and arm issues warrant that too. This kind of symptoms also needs screening for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Your physician can help you for that too.  7. If you have got tested the above in past 8 weeks, you may upload the reports here for my review and diagnosis. If more than 8 weeks old, please go for repeat fresh tests. Biopsy and histopathology of the lymph nodes. Can be decided on investigations and diagnosis. Revert back with the investigation reports to an internal medicine physician online.--->"
Q. Is it normal to have cobblestone appearance at the back of throat after tonsillectomy?,"Hello doctor, I had tonsillectomy about a month ago. I had been healing but I am concerned about my healing process. My uvula has gotten smaller and has strange color plus I see cobblestone at the back of throat and blue or dark red color surrounding soft palate. And there are visible blue or red blood vessels everywhere around the palate and arch.","Hi. All these are normal after tonsillectomy surgery. I will suggest some steps to relieve some of the symptoms you are facing. Gargles with Benzydamine mouth wash diluted in water few times daily will help soothe the area and relieve pain. You may also take Tylenol for a few days for the pain relief. To relieve inflammation (the engorged blood vessels and cobblestone formation) you can take a combination of Trypsin Chymotrypsin Bromelain Rutopside. This medicine will relieve inflammatory cells and products from the area. Cobblestone formation is normal after the surgery. Regarding the reduced length of the uvula and the scarring on the palate, I would say, they are due to bad surgical technique. We carefully dissect the tonsil out of the pillars so that there is nil scarring of pillars and change to the uvula. We use a coblator for the purpose that minimizes bleeding and postoperative pain."

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception.

Q. I had unprotected sex during my infertile days. Can I be pregnant?,"Hi doctor, I am 32 years old female. I had unprotected intercourse 14 days back with no ejaculation from his end. I took an I-pill the next day at 8 PM for precaution. Those were my infertile days as my last period occurred 36 days ago. It has been more than a month; still I have not got my periods. Could you suggest some ways to get back my periods? Thank you.","Hi. Please wait for a week for your period to start. If it does not start by then, you will have to do urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Period could have been delayed due to stress. Another rare possibility is that of pregnancy. Though you mentioned the days you had sex as your infertile days, sometimes occasionally ovulation could be delayed making the days fertile. Still you had taken emergency pill (though it is highly effective in preventing pregnancy, protection offered is not absolute). So, there can be little chance of pregnancy which you need to rule out first. If you want to rule out pregnancy earlier, you can do blood beta-hCG test, negative result of which will rule out pregnancy. Other option as I told is to wait for a week. If pregnancy test comes negative and still period does not start, you can induce period by taking tablet Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for five days. Period generally starts within a week of last dose of tablet. It will not induce period if you are pregnant."

Either the process of abortion has been incomplete, because of which the uterus is still trying to expel out the products of conception. Or you have some blood problem. Are you still passing clots? Or is it plain blood that is coming? Also, if you could tell me exactly how you proceeded to take the medicine it would give an idea of the cause of bleeding.

Q. I am 13 weeks pregnant. Kindly explain about subseptate uterus.,"Hello doctor, I am 13 weeks pregnant. I have been diagnosed with subseptate uterus with the live fetus in the left horn. Baby is good, with heartbeat and growth. My doctor has advised me proper rest and some medicines. I want to know in detail about this subseptate uterus.","Hello. Let me start with a few basic facts and further clinical correlates and effects. Every lady has two uterine tubes, which fuse at birth, and over time, the wall between the two tubes disappear. Now the uterus is converted into a single cavity uterus. The upper ends of tubes remain separate as two fallopian tubes. Sometimes the fusion is complete, but the partition does not disappear. If the tubes do not touch others or do not fuse at all, then you get bicornuate uterus. But if only the wall is partially removed, it forms subseptate uterus. If the wall does not disappear at all, then the septate uterus is formed. Now in both the last two conditions, the main problem is that the space inside the uterus is compromised. The best option was to have a hysteroscopic resection of septa then get pregnant. Having rest makes no difference. At 14 to 16 the week, she can undergo an elective cervical cerclage. Due to septa, uterus loses its polarity, and she is prone to cervical insufficiency. As space inside the uterus is compromised, she can have preterm pains, preterm labor. Due to septate, the baby presentation may not be head down. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."

What causes respiratory problem in a 36-year-old?,"Hello doctor, My mother is 36 years old, and she is suffering from the respiratory problem from last two days, her hemoglobin count is 9.6, can you please tell what causes this problem?","Hello. I have read through your question and would like to tell you that respiratory problems can be due to allergic or due to infection. Her Haemoglobin could be due to dietary deficiency. Give her iron-rich diet like dates, banana, and green leafy vegetables. If the respiratory problem is due to infection, then she may need an antibiotic course. For now, steam inhalation will help to relieve her. Steam inhalation with menthol twice daily. If her condition does not improve in two days, get her checked by a physician. If her Hemoglobin does not improve in one month, get a complete blood profile done to know the cause of anemia. I hope that answers your question. If you have any further questions, please feel free to write."

The blue fillings purpose is to prevent me from biting down on the braces, but when will they get removed? Also, when will I feel comfortable biting down on my fillings, since my teeth are sore and it hurts, or when will I get actually to chew since I can only swallow?","Hello. Blue fillings or bites are removed when your teeth are better aligned, and deep bite (if present) is improved or corrected enough to prevent interference of upper teeth to lower braces. It takes a while to get used to the blue bites, usually 7 to 14 days. However, chewing continues to be less effective for longer.

It is better to increase the dose by 25 mcg, i.e. 175 mcg if she was using 150 mcg till date escalating the dose or thyroid medication will be like 25 to 50 mcg at a time. Not double the dose causes severe sickness. As you mentioned, she was Synthroid (Levothyroxine). It is better to continue the medication to maintain a normal thyroid level for a long time. After using this medication 175 mcg, it is better to repeat the thyroid profile after six weeks to check for that thyroid level."

Usually red blood cell will be round and plate shape. During dehydration and less oxygen time the shape of the red blood cell becomes sickle shape. Now RBC will stick together and block the blood vessels and produce ischemia. So to reduce the obstruction, you need fluids more. If obstruction is in lung, spleen, kidney or any organ, it is dangerous and severe painful. So avoid dehydration conditions, do not do severe exercise, avoid going to hill stations where oxygen is less. Drink adequate water."

What causes this? Can this be fixed?","Hello. Based on the given history, it can be due to the extra force you gave to open the mouth while on elastics. Based on your age, it can be due to an impacted wisdom tooth. Sometimes, this can be due to any muscle problem too (myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome), mostly due to physical stress in that area or emotional or mental stress. As for now, do not open your mouth very wide, like during yawning, etc. This is curable. Do not worry much. Do you have pain along with the click? I would suggest you talk to your orthodontist or general dentist or oral and maxillofacial surgeon to get a final diagnosis after a clinical examination done by them.

Q. I had spotting on the next day of my unprotected sex.

Now a week later, I have been bleeding for two days. I hope this is not a sign of pregnancy. Please help me understand it better.","Hello. Ideally, the emergency contraceptive pill is to be taken within 72 hours of last intercourse to be effective 99 %. It is of no importance if taken after a week. Nevertheless, the bleeding which you got mid cycle before you took the pill was likely to be an ovulation bleed as you had sex in your safe period, then you took the high dose progesterone emergency pill, which initiated a progesterone withdrawal after two days in the form of bleeding as expected. This rules out pregnancy as you had a withdrawal bleed, but it is always best in such cases to get a serum beta hCG test done to be conclusively sure."

He is active and wants to eat and drink. So is this something more serious than we think or am I too worried?","Hello. If there is no blood in stools, it is mostly viral. It usually gets settle in five days. Important here is maintaining hydration. Make sure you give him plenty of fluid, ORS (oral rehydration solution). If he is vomiting, you can ask your doctor to prescribe Ondansetron. Give him probiotics and keep a watch on urine output. If he is passing adequate urine, then there is no point of worry."
Q. Does my skin test indicate tuberculosis?,"Hello doctor, Looking for an opinion on tuberculosis skin test. Please answer if you have experience with PPD skin tests. I am 34 years old, former cigarette smoker. My friend got diagnosed with tuberculosis due to strong arthritis medications, and I have had some contact with him. I have attached images of my skin test below.","Hi. Montoux test, PPD test is a very non-specific test and does not give you any confirmation for tuberculosis. It is used as an adjuvant test for diagnosis and never as sole test. It is read after 48 hours of injection. You have not mentioned the duration. You have to measure its diameter. It should be less then 10 x 10 mm. I cannot measure it online but apparently it is negative for tuberculosis (attachment removed to protect patient identity)."
Q. How can tight foreskin be managed?,"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old, boy and I have a very tight foreskin and I have not even pulled it back. I tried to do it once using oil but it was of no use.","Hello. The mentioned history is suggestive of phimosis in which foreskin cannot be retracted back over glans. Topical steroid cream can be beneficial in mild case. But, in severe case like in your case, if foreskin cannot be retracted, then circumcision like day care minor surgery can be done. So, I suggest you consult Urologist for your examination and operation."

Q. What are the ways to stop sugar addiction?,"Hello doctor, I am having sugar addiction. I always eat candy non-stop and chips and soda, but I am so addicted that I failed the 30-day sugar free challenge in the first three hours itself. I need help, how can I stop this addiction if all my ways are failing everytime I keep trying.","Hello. Sugar is not an illicit drug, but the brain acts in a similar manner to other substance abuse and addictions. Another reason you could be craving sugar regularly is due to how it makes you feel after consuming it. Generally, a sugary treat causes a rush of both glucose and endorphins in your blood. One of the best things you can do to fight your sugar addiction is to start by swapping sweet foods for healthy alternatives like vegetables. Yes, vegetables can be sweet, but the natural sugars you find in carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, and peas are so much lower than what you will find in treats such as gummies, cookies, or donuts. At the same time, they’ will satisfy your craving for sweetness and you can train yourself to eat these healthier choices over-addictive sugary desserts.  The last small tip for fighting your sugar addiction is to generate a plan for how you will eat. You can write this plan out, post it somewhere, or simply keep a mental note of it, but a plan can help you to succeed in various situations. For example, keep carrot sticks cut up in your fridge so that after work, you can plan to snack on those instead of cookies. Or if you are going out to brunch, decide that your plan is to order an omelet with vegetables so that pancakes (basically, a maple syrup delivery device) is not an option. The idea here is to have a plan for how you will succeed in various scenarios that typically create problems for you."
Q. What causes a soft spot in the middle of forehead in a baby?,"Hello doctor, My daughter has a soft spot in the middle of her forehead for the past nine months but can only be noticed when she raises her eyebrows or if the lighting is right. When sliding a finger over it you cannot feel anything, the forehead feels normal even when she has her eyebrows raised. It looks like a soft slightly raised lump when you can notice it. I have taken her to the doctors but they could not see anything. I had to show them photos as sometimes it really stands out, other times you cannot see it. What should I do?","Hello. Small spot in center of forehead is seen in some pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As you know skull is made up of 16 small bones, these bones are attached with cartilages and get ossified with times. Due to some gaping, this swelling is seen. Give your kid Calcirol sachet once a week for five weeks, dissolve in two spoon water. Syrup Ostebon (Calcium) one teaspoon full twice a day. Feris drops 1 ml once a day. Zincovit drops one ml once a day. Vitanova drops 0.5 ml once a day. All the above for six months."
Q. Is it possible to have infertility due to low progesterone levels?,"Hello doctor, I recently took a women's health test to test my hormones. I just got my results back and my Progesterone level is extremely low where as my Estradiol level is in the normal range. I have dealt with many irregular periods since I was young and have not been able to conceive a child with my husband and now I think I know why. I was wondering if my results can be looked at by a doctor to give me anymore information on what is going on with my test results. I am only 25.","Hello. The reports are fairly normal including the hormonal profile but the progesterone levels (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If these levels are from the proliferative phase then they can be considered normal, however, if from the luteal phase, then they are definitely low. Considering that LH was 11, this test may have been done around day 10 to 14 of your cycle, was it? In cases of progesterone deficiency, one tends to get anovulatory cycles and also shortened cycles with mid cycle bleeds and irregular shedding with often passage of clots, so if not so and if you are experiencing delayed irregular cycles then cause is likely PCOS and not progesterone per se. Also, important in any fertility evaluation is the the male fertility factor. It is important to learn if the semen analysis report of your partner is normal or not, whether the quality and quantity of his sperms are good or not, so please share his semen analysis report as well for review."
Q. My intraocular pressure is getting high in the last six years. Why?,"Hello doctor,Over the past six years or so, my intraocular pressure (both eyes) has risen to 16, to 19, and now to 21. Will it continue to increase still? Kindly help.","Hello. As you might have been informed, increased eye pressure is mainly associated with the disease called glaucoma. This chronic symptomless disease is very drastic to the optic nerve and might lead to irreversible damage, and in the end, cause blindness. However, this eye disease is never diagnosed or established based on eye pressure measurements and requires a detailed and comprehensive examination including many diagnostic tests like, visual fields, gonioscopy, OCT (optical coherence tomography), multiple measurements of eye pressure during at least three consecutive days and these tests might be repeated twice and even thrice in the first year and then every six months if the only suspicion remains. If you have not undergone these tests, please do, and if you require a second opinion, please upload the results of all these tests and I will gladly provide you with my opinion."
Q. What can be done for swollen gums where wisdom tooth is erupting?,"Hello doctor, I think my right side bottom wisdom tooth is coming as there is a ball on the back side of my gum that is really swollen. It almost feels like a pimple and the area around it has white lines on the inner cheek wall. What should I do?","Hello. If there is not much pain, it is better to let it grow fully. It may take a month or two to fully come out. If it does not, and the area gets painful then better to get an X-ray done for its exact position. Use warm salt water gargle twice a day for a week or two. Use a chewing gum on that side, it helps in faster growth of the tooth into occlusion."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Q. Kindly have a look on my chest X-ray and explain.,"Hello doctor, I had severe cough and mucus formation which was in yellow. The doctor had prescribed antibiotics, Salbutamol tablet and allergy tablets. Now that cough has reduced but I feel some heaviness at the back right hand side and when waking up in the morning. While I had visited the doctor they had adviced me to take an X-ray. Later they said there is slight pneumonia and to continue antibiotics (Azithromycin) for five days. Also, I have completed my antibiotics dose for four days, still left with one more day. Cough is not there currently and better. I am attaching X-ray that was taken for your advice. Would like to have a second opinion on the X-ray report.","Hello. In attached X-ray report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there is presence of slight consolidation in right side. So, it is suggestive of pneumonia like infection. For that, you need to complete antibiotic course. If clinically improved well, then no need for further work up."
"Q. Which one should I opt for a vision problem, a laser treatment or specs?","Hello doctor, I would like to know to weather the laser treatment is better than continuing specs for vision. What would be the drawbacks of laser treatment, is it very complicated?","Hello. This is quite a common question youngsters ask. The best answer to this is it depends on you and your daily activities, profession, and lifestyle, etc. For example, if you want to take up professional sports, modeling, enjoy adventure sports, few jobs in the armed forces, getting a surgery done would be quite necessary.  On the other hand, if you want to pursue higher studies and professions where you work a lot with computers and work on fine parts like watchmaking, then surgery would put you at a slight disadvantage as it slightly reduces image quality and increases chances of getting dry eye diseases. Some surgeons also prefer wearing glasses as it protects against infection and blood spurts during operations.  With the latest equipment and techniques, laser refractive surgery is quite safe, and outcomes are good. The risk involved is very less. Although a power of - 5.0 is on the higher side, we can still expect good results given that your corneas are suitable for the surgery.  The main thing to consider is of course long term outcomes are, 1. As a woman, your power will naturally change during pregnancy and lactation, and this happens to all women. Some have more, others less. This is unpredictable. 2. Surgery only corrects you for distance vision. Another natural change in eyes is presbyopia. Here you need to wear reading glasses. So even if you were to get surgery now, you would only remain glasses free for up to around 40 years of age after which you need reading glasses. I hope this answers your doubts. In case you have any further questions please let me know."
Q. What are the tests I have to undergo after having unprotected oral sex?,"Hello doctor,I had an oral sex with a girl without protection, and I licked her vagina too, later I came to know she has PSV which she had undergone treatment and she was cured, I came to know risks of the STD's via oral sex and I was suggested to have test after four weeks, but they did not tell what test I have to go through in detail. My query is, what is the list of a test I have to go through? Please give me the names of the test in detail, so that I can approach a lab for testing.","Hello. There are many tests, but the below mentioned are usually done to rule out the infection. These are a screening test.  1. Test for HIV. Tridot test. 2.Test for gonorrhea (urine or oral swab) and chlamydia. 3. Test for Hepatitis B (HBsAg) and C virus. 4. Test for syphilis such as VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory test) and if required RPR (rapid plasma reagin) test. 5. Test for HPV (human papilloma virus). Herpes virus test is usually not required if no symptoms are present or there is no outbreak of it. I hope this clarifies your concern. Ask again if anything unanswered,"
Q. Is Bimatoprost safe enough for optical nerve damage?,"Hello doctor, My mother, is 76 years old, currently suffering from low, blurry vision (both near sight and far sight). Her BP, sugar, and thyroid are normal. A year before, she was critically suffered from urosepsis with AKI, DM II, pleural effusion, etc. but recovered. Though she has the first stage of renal failure and ventricular ectopic in ECG now. Recently she visited an eye hospital where she was told that her eye problem is mainly due to gradual damage of optical nerve, which is irreversible and the doctor cannot do much. In this respect, she was tested with digital fundus photography and OCT (Retina -Tessellated fundus in the right eye, FR dull in left eye). As per doctor's mention, I come to know that she has some cataract in the right eye (nuclear sclerosis grade II diagnosed in both eye) which need to operate soon for better vision, but I am not sure about it as it is not written in prescription as a diagnosis. She is advised to take a drop of Bimatoprost 0.01 % in both eyes every day to control optical damage. Now, I like to know is this medicine helpful if she complains with optical nerve damage without glaucoma or cataract. Is there any other solution to save her vision or further damage at least.","Hello. I understand your concerns, and I am very sorry to hear about your mother's eye changes. I am afraid that the changes in the optic nerve are indeed irreversible and according to the reports is near total. This is known by the part of the reports that say CDR 0.9 in both eyes. To explain it in a very simple manner, the eye is like a camera, both have lenses, and just like the camera has a film, the eye has the retina. If there is a problem in both the lens and the film, simply changing the lens would not improve the quality of the picture as the film (retina) is also compromised. But in few cases may improve to a limited, yet unknown extent. The problem also gets compounded with her poor general condition with heart problems along with the recent sepsis. So operating on her cataract is quite risky. Regarding the eye drops, Brimonidine eye drops have been known to help in neuroprotection and may help in the preservation of whatever optic nerve function is left, theoretically. So this would be the thought process behind this plan of management given to the overall condition. As far as the next step in managing, it depends on the daily activities of your mother and if at all she feels her current vision is not enough for her to carry out the daily routine activities. In case you need more information, please let me know."
"Q. Other than Sutent, which medicine can I opt for papillary renal cell carcinoma?","Hello doctor,My father is recently diagnosed with papillary renal cell carcinoma type 1, and he has no BP or sugar. However, he had undergone bypass surgery ten years ago. Our doctor has suggested targeted therapy is better for him as there is another mass found in the lungs too. Our doctor has prescribed Sutent 37.5 mg, to begin with, and slowly increase it to 50 mg.However, due to our financial conditions, we cannot afford Sutent as it is pretty expensive for us. As we do not have any insurance. Is this the only drug available for this type of cancer, or do we have any other affordable and similar drugs with minimal side effects? We want to get your suggestion on this. Kindly help.","Hello. As per history given above. Your father as metastatic renal cell carcinoma. I would have liked to have few additional markers like his general condition, report of CBC (complete blood count) and LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test) to look at his risk score. In metastatic RCC, in first-line settings we have three TKI (Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) that are approved and commonly used. Namely, Sunitinib, Pazopanib, and Cabozantinib. Sunitinib and pazopanib have almost the same progression-free and survival benefit. Cabozantinib has benefit in progression, but final overall survival was the same as sunitinib. Toxicities are bit different for Pazopanib with more chances of hepatitis, weight loss, and diarrhea. If you are not affording for Sunitinib, then I would say Pazopanib would be better as it is cheaper with similar benefits and slightly different toxicities. Cabozantinib is costlier and not yet available. I hope it helps. I would be happy to help you further if you have any more queries or questions regarding toxicities of these drugs. TKI."
Q. How to hide the gap that will occur due to the wearing of braces?,"Hello doctor,I am going to get braces soon, and I am going to have a large gap, is there anything a dentist could make to hide my gap?","Hello. Braces are placed to align your teeth more esthetically and camouflage the malpositioned teeth. From your question what I have understood is either you have a large gap already, and for that, you do not have to worry, braces will close it, or you are saying that during treatment you are going to have a gap because of the teeth removal. In that case, I want you to know that a few teeth are removed during orthodontic braces treatment to get space for the rest of the teeth to move and align themselves, and ultimately the gap will be closed. So, in both cases, the gap will be minimized or closed. You do not have to worry. Maintain proper oral hygiene, be careful with the brackets, do not break them, follow the advice of the orthodontist and do not miss any follow-ups as these minor steps will help the treatment to finish on time or maybe a little earlier too. Now, if you can elaborate on your question, I can answer more precisely. A picture of the gap will be helpful also."
Q. What is the treatment for a 11-year-old patient with combined type 1 and 2 diabetes?,"Hello doctor, The patient is 11 years old, and right from birth, he is suffering from type 1 and 2 diabetics. Initially, he was on injection and now on tablets every day. As per the doctor, his pancreas is not working from his birth. Can you please let me know if there is any treatment available for this? Also, can the bone marrow blood infusion technique help in treating this issue permanently?","Hello. Yes, there is a procedure called pancreatic transplant. It must be taking place in your place as well. You can click on the individual hospital website and check if they have a pancreatic transplant facility, but it could be very expensive. But let me tell you one thing that even after any transplant, the patient has to take immunosuppressive medications all his life and compared to that the diabetes pills are still a better option."
Q. Is it safe to get a filling fixed while running a low-grade fever from a UTI?,"Hello doctor, Can I get a filling fixed while running a low-grade fever from a UTI?","Hello. Theoretically, yes. But, practically I would not suggest you get it done as you will not be comfortable (mainly because of the water spray from the handpiece or drilling machine) and that will make it difficult for the dentist too. If it is an emergency or you do not have accompanying stuffed nose or difficulty in breathing through the nose, then you can go for filling. Depends on your comfort level and severity of your condition. I hope this has helped."
Q. What should be done when a 5-year-old has a fever of 102° with TLC 16700?,"Hello doctor,My son is having a fever of 102°. He is 5 years and 4 months old. Since last two days, his temperature is not reducing. We have given Ibuprofen plus paracetamol syrup. Tablet Zedocef (100) DT 1 tablet twice a daily for five days after food. Syprup Ondem 5 ml thrice daily 1/2 hour before food, syrup Ibuprofen, paracetamol 7.5 ml 6 hours once after food. We tested his blood, but there was no malaria or typhoid. But his TLC is 16700. He is not taking any food, but sometimes he drinks ORS. So suggest us what to do?","Hello. You are already giving multiple antibiotics and antipyretics. The TLC (total leucocyte count) count in the report is on the higher side, which suggests some bacterial infection. Continue with the advised treatment. Some times fever may take three to four days to respond. Continue to give Ibugesic plus for each episode of fever for now. Cold sponging also helps to bring down the temperature. Get a repeat CBC (complete blood count) and Urine microscopy done. If fever is persisting and not responding to oral medication. The child may require admission for starting IV antibiotics. A complete clinical examination by the pediatrician to find out foci of infection is recommended."

Q. How to find out if my son is suffering from any communication problem?,"Hello doctor, I have twins, a boy and a girl aged 2 years. I noticed that the girl advanced in skills than the boy. In the first few months of life, my son was faster than his sister in the growth and everything. And then, it was reversed. I am a graduate of psychology. I have a brother suffering from autism and frankly, I have a fear of this disease. I do not care and I do not want to surrender to delusions. But, mom and dad insist on reminding me of everything you see them that my son is also the possibility of getting hurt. I started since 10 months; I am watching my son very much. I blame him if he did not implement what I am asking. He says dad and mom. He loves to play, laugh and shake hands if I asked him to do so. He looks into my eyes when I talk, but I do not feel that he understands what I am saying to him always. For example, if I asked him to bring me cheesed off the table, he does not focus with me and ignore me. On the other hand, if he feels he is thirsty, then he will come to me and say a bottle of water. I know this is probably because the rate of a normal IQ and concentration varies from one to another child. I want a word from the doctor that makes me serenely scream in the face of all of the notes that my son is not normal and I tell them that my son safe and sound. The question is how completely I know that my son is not suffering from any problems in communicating diseases or behavior?","Hi. I have gone through the query with keen interest and understand your concerns. Before making any opinions I need to inform you that take the things in objective manner and not on emotions I understand there is history of autism in the family and it does not mean your child suffers with autism. In a normal growing child there are many ups and downs and not responding on some occasions is not indicative of serious pathology like autism. We need to take notice that a child plays well with another child, responds to language on most occasions, cheerful, not having any abnormal repetitive stereotyped movements and communicates with the mother. Having said this I feel it will be appropriate to fill a simple questionnaire called Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). This is a screening instrument for autism and you will know probably with sure that whether there is problem or not. If you still feel there is something abnormal, then you may contact the specialist doctor nearby for a physical evaluation. For further information consult a psychologist counsellor online -->"

Q. Will taking antibiotics cause diarrhea or loose stools?,"Hello doctor,I took antibiotics about a month ago, and ever since the fourth day of antibiotic treatment, I have been suffering from diarrhea or loose stools. On the fourth day, I had bad cramps and loose stools that lasted from the fourth day to the seventh day. This then returned afterward with even worse pains, but this time, I had yellow stool followed by diarrhea. Ever since I have been having loose stools on and off that is foul smelling and mushy. Is this because of the antibiotics, or is it an infection?","Hello. Your diarrhea could be a direct side effect of the antibiotic, in which case, it should resolve after stopping the antibiotic. It could also be due to a condition called Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff for short). C. diff is a bacterium typically found in the intestines of most people. But under certain circumstances (frequent exposure to antibiotics), a couple of strains of this bacteria can multiply and produce toxins (called C diff toxin A and B). This can provide diarrhea-sometimes bloody, with crampy abdominal pain. I suggest getting tested for C diff. You need to submit a stool sample for C diff toxin. If it is positive, there are treatments for it includes oral Vancomycin, Fidaxomicin, or Metronidazole. I hope this helps."

Sometimes thinking about this problem, I become depreciate. I needed your help.","Hello. The white coating on your tongue is mostly due to bacteria and debris. And, it seems that you might have a dry mouth. All this must be causing bad breath. Clean or scrape your tongue regularly, maintain proper oral hygiene, drink a lot of water and even empty stomach will cause bad breath, so have food regularly on time. Do mouth rinse with lukewarm water and salt or lukewarm water and a bit of mouthwash diluted in the water. But, better to avoid continuous use of mouthwash as this itself can cause dry mouth sometimes, and discoloration of teeth. Get a consultation from a dentist regarding dry mouth, to rule it out. If you have dry mouth, a Sialogogue (to increase salivary flow) will be prescribed by the dentist. Do not worry. You will be fine. If possible, send me a picture of your tongue and teeth."

Q. What can I do to straighten my curved lumbar spine and un-cant hips?,"Hello doctor,I am a 19-year-old male. Around two months back, I had a hiccup when dead-lifting and my lower back or lumbar spine area had a sharp pain. At the time, I did not think much of it and since then discontinued dead-lifts. Over time, I have developed some sciatica in my left hamstring area. I visited a chiropractor about two weeks ago and he took X-rays of my spine, revealing that my lumbar spine is curved to the right, canting my hips and therefore putting pressure on my sciatic nerve. I went in for three adjustments with him, over a one and half week span. I no longer have access to my chiropractor, being that I am overseas. My question is what can I do by myself in order to straighten out my lumbar spine and un-cant my hips so that my sciatic nerve can get some relief? Am I going to have to find another chiropractor and get more adjustments while I am over here? Note that the discomfort of sciatica only happens with a straight left leg when bending at the waist.","Hi. Based on what you wrote, it sounds as though you may have scoliosis, a wedged vertebrae in the lumbar spine, a disc issue, or even lower cross syndrome. If there is any way to attach images of the X-rays, that would be ideal (though I know the current situation is not ideal). Assuming it is indeed a scoliosis curvature, I can tell you that you will not be able to straighten your spine (anatomically speaking). If it is a lower cross syndrome, your best bet while you are overseas is to work on core stabilization exercises. Bridge exercises, planks, and clams may all be beneficial to the lumbopelvic-hip-complex. All of these exercises can be found online, but essentially we want to strengthen the weak muscles and relax the overactive muscle. Please get the help of internet resources to have a knowledge of lower cross syndrome to get an idea of what muscles may be overactive and underactive. Without examining you myself, or seeing X-rays, this is about all of the information I can provide. When you return to your place, I would recommend continuing treatment with your chiropractor.

Q. Is it advisable to use Neomycin during first month of pregnancy?,"Hello doctor, My wife is currently on her sixth month of pregnancy. I am pretty much concerned about using Neomycin 0.5 % and Clobetasol 0.05 % ointment during the first month of our pregnancy. We had itching and burning sensation. We used approximately 4 g of ointment in total. She applied some ointment over her inguinal area and me over head of penis and we also had intercourse after that. This happened two times. Would this have caused vaginal absorption of Neomycin and damaged the fetus? Or as it was the month of conception would it have damaged the sperms, egg or the fertilized egg? I read some articles where topical Neomycin has caused ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and reduced spermatogenesis in males. Should I have terminated the pregnancy earlier? Should I monitor the baby after birth for these toxicities? We did three scans so far dating scan, NT scan and anomaly scan which are normal.","Hello. There are possibilities of absorption per vaginally and I agree there are reports of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity but as she is six months pregnant now and all scans are normal so there are no morphological anomalies in the child but as far as ear hearing abnormalities are concerned, that cannot be detected by scans. Also, as on date after 20 weeks of gestation, pregnancy cannot be terminated by law unless gross abnormalities are evident in the foetus and permission would have to be sought by high court only."

"Q. I am having PCOS, and trying to conceive for eight months. What is the treatment?","Hello doctor, I am 33 years old. I have been trying to conceive for eight months from now. I have monthly periods and positive OPKs and BBT shifts, but periods are also very light, basically spotting. I had an Ultrasound which showed a few cysts, had mildly elevated testosterone, normal LH and FSH, normal estrogen, low progesterone. My PCP is not convinced. I have PCOS but I am wondering if that is still a possibility and what I should anticipate for treatment in the future (clomid vs. progesterone therapy, etc.)?","Hello. The fact that you are getting positive OPKs each cycle indicates that you have an anovulatory cycle or in simple terms that you are ovulating regularly. PCOD (polycystic ovarian syndrome) cannot be diagnosed alone with just small cysts in ovaries, rather one should have around 10 to 12 multiple small subcenterimetric follicles lining the periphery of the ovary during midcycle scan, one should have featyres of clinical hyperandrogenism like acne, hirsutism (excessive facial and body hair), acanthosis and most importantly oligomenorrhoea or irregular menses. Testosterone alone does not justify the diagnosis. However, if o e needs to be sure, then AMH (ante Mullerian hormone) test can be done, which is more than four indicates PCOD. As mentioned that you are on thyroid medications, I believe your TSH levels are less than five. Please share your ultrasound and hormonal profile reports for review. Now, it would also be essential to check for your partner's semen analysis for quality and quantity of sperms. I am not sure if you have any kids before or not as you have not mentioned, but if you do not yet, then semen analysis of your partner would be mandatory, as your reports are relatively normal. Progesterone deficiency can be treated, and even Clomid can be contemplated only of the male infertility factor has been ruled out first."
"Q. Are tonsil stones, sore throat, and swollen gums symptoms of oral or throat cancer?","Hello doctor, I have tonsil stones, sore throat, swollen gums, and dry cough. Is this the symptoms of oral or throat cancer?","Hello. A recurrent sore throat can occur in a number of pathologies. Most often it is as a result of some local pathology like Rhinosinusitis, nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), LPR (laryngopharyngeal reflux). Rather than relapsing and recurring course malignancies tend to have a progressive course. Further age is a crucial factor. Younger people usually do not have malignancies. Your doctor must have checked your throat, and he would for sure have picked something if there was any such thing. GERD and LPR are mainly known to cause recurrent sore throat. Malignancy is the last thing one would suspect at your age."
